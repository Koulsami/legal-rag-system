  "query": "What is the test for inventive step under Singapore patent law?",
  "answer": "Under Section 15 of the Patents Act, an invention is considered to involve an inventive step if it is not obvious to a person skilled in the art, having regard to any matter which forms part of the state of the art. This test was further clarified in First Currency Choice Pte Ltd v Main-Line Corporate Holdings Ltd [2008] where the Court of Appeal held that the invention must involve a technical advance that is not obvious. The court emphasized that the assessment should be made from the perspective of a person skilled in the relevant technical field, considering the common general knowledge available at the priority date.",
