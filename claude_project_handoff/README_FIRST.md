## Project File Organization

### üìÅ EXISTING PROJECT CONTENT (Keep for Context)
- `01_Core_Requirements/` - Original requirements and design
- `02_Patent/` - Patent documentation  
- `03_Architecture/` - System architecture
- `04_Evaluation/` - Evaluation methodology
- `05_Academic_Foundation/` - Research papers
- `07_Examples/` - Design examples and specifications

### üìÅ NEW IMPLEMENTATION CODE (Actual Working Code)
- `validation/` - **REAL validation pipeline code**
- `evaluation/` - **REAL benchmark code**
- `src/` - **REAL retrieval and generation code**
- `evaluation/reports/` - **ACTUAL test results**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Changed
The code in `06_Code_Examples/` was **design mockups**.
The new files are the **actual implementation**.

**If you see naming conflicts:**
- Prioritize files in `validation/`, `evaluation/`, `src/`
- These are the real, working, tested implementations

## Quick Start
1. Read: `PROJECT_MANIFEST.md`
2. Check: `CURRENT_STATUS.txt`
3. Fix: `validation/integrated_validation_pipeline.py`

**The system works! Just needs one validation logic fix.**
