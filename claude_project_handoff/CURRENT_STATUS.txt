LEGAL RAG SYSTEM - CURRENT STATUS
==================================

✅ WORKING
----------
- End-to-end RAG pipeline functional
- Perfect citation recognition (1.00)
- Zero hallucinations (0.00%)
- Synthesis scoring operational
- Query 4 passing with "review" decision

❌ PRIMARY ISSUE
----------------
Issue: 4/5 queries failing despite perfect citations
Cause: Validation expecting case law citations for statute-only queries
Location: validation/integrated_validation_pipeline.py - _make_decision()
Fix: Add logic to accept perfect citations + decent synthesis

⚠️  SECONDARY ISSUE
-------------------
Issue: Dense search failing silently on every query
Cause: Unknown (error not logged with details)
Location: src/retrieval/hybrid_retriever.py - _dense_search()
Fix: Add full exception logging

METRICS
-------
Pass Rate:          20.0% (1/5)
Citation Precision: 1.00  ✅
Synthesis Score:    0.46  
Hallucination Rate: 0.00% ✅
Response Time:      ~8s per query

FAILED QUERIES
--------------
ma_001: reject - "Missing case law citation" (synthesis: 0.48, citation: 1.00)
ma_002: reject - "Missing case law citation" (synthesis: 0.32, citation: 1.00)
ma_003: reject - "Missing case law citation" (synthesis: 0.48, citation: 1.00)
ma_005: reject - "Missing case law citation" (synthesis: 0.48, citation: 1.00)

PASSED QUERIES
--------------
ma_004: review - Good synthesis (0.52, citation: 1.00)

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Fix validation decision logic (Priority 1)
2. Fix dense search error (Priority 2)
3. Run full 50-query benchmark (Priority 3)
